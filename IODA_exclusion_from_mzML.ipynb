    "# IODA exclusion-from-mzML notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: This notebook generates exclusion table formatted for XCalibur and MaxQuant.Live. It accepts as input one mzML file from one sample data. The ions detected will be added the exclusion list. If you already have an mzTab, we recommend using the dedicated [IODA exclusion-from-mzTab notebook](IODA_exclusion_from_mzTab.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to customise feature detection with OpenMS, we recommend [using the OpenMS workflow locally](link_documentation) and upload the resulting mzTab to the [IODA exclusion-from-mzTab notebook](IODA_exclusion_from_mzTab.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation**: Please refer to the documentation page for more informations on the for IODA exclusion-from-mzML worklow. [See here](link).\n",

    "**Instructions**: \n",

    "- Provide the mzTab for the sample data to be used. \n",

Parameters should be optimised depending on the sample complexity and acquisition parameters.\n",
